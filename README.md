# Project development background
After research and consultation at tehlug (Tehran Linux Lug), also experimenting coding on AIDE, Android Studio and QT Creator, I decided to develop this App using Qt/C++. Download & Installation of Android Studio in Iran was the biggest trouble, since embargo does not allow download of the mentioned tools. Qt could generate Android, iOS and Windows Phone Apps. That feature would be important in the future. I found a very helpful example and started developing based on that example. The Android App uses phone/tablet camera and have two capture buttons; one for odd pages, one for even pages. There is another button in App to turn-on camera flash. After auto focusing on the 1st page, it would be possible to lock focus. This would significantly improve speed and performance of scanning.
